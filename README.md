## Overview
This repository contributes to the development of **secure, scalable, and interoperable data-sharing infrastructure**. It supports NDTP’s mission to enable **trusted, federated, and decentralised** data-sharing across organisations.

This repository is one of several open-source components that underpin NDTP’s **Integration Architecture (IA)**—a framework designed to allow organisations to manage and exchange data securely while maintaining control over their own information. The IA is actively deployed and tested across multiple sectors, ensuring its adaptability and alignment with real-world needs.

For a complete overview of the Integration Architecture (IA) project, please see the [Integration Architecture Documentation](https://github.com/National-Node-Net/integration-architecture-documentation).

## Prerequisites
Before using this repository, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
- **Required Tooling:**
    - Java 17
    - Github PAT token set to allow retrieval of maven packages from Github Packages
    - Docker (if running via docker)
- **Pipeline Requirements:**
    - Cloud platform credentials
- **Supported Kubernetes Versions:** N/A
- **System Requirements:**
    - Java 17
    - Docker
    - Kafka (or connectivity to) - if applicable

## Quick Start
This repository does not really provide runnable code, rather it provides libraries that are used as building blocks to create runnable code in other repositories.

There are however some debugging tools found in the cli/cli-debug module that can be run via the included cli/cli-debug/debug.sh script.
See the [`debug.sh`](docs/cli/debug.md) documentation for more details.

This is a Java project built with Maven, please see BUILD for detailed build and development instructions. Provided you meet the basic requirements the following should work:

### 1. Download and Build
```sh  
git clone https://github.com/National-Node-Net/secure-agents-lib.git
cd [secure-agents-lib]  
```
### 2. Run Build Version
```sh  
mvn clean install --version  
```
## Features
The following features are currently available:

- `cli` - Provides a CLI for exercising this code base and running the Projectors.
  - `cli-api` - Provides the CLI API for implementing new commands.
  - `cli-debug` - Provides commands for various tools that do not constitute direct functionality, e.g. dumping the RDF from a Kafka topic, but which are useful for debugging. This can be invoked via the debug script in this module.

- `configurator` - Provides a lightweight configuration API for obtaining application configuration.

- `event-sources` - Provides Event Sources.

  - `event-sources-lib` - Provides an API for representing and accessing Event Sources.

  - `event-source-kafka` - Provides a Kafka backed implementation of the Event Source API.

- `jaxrs-base-server` - Provides a base JAX-RS server template to build server applications from.

- `live-reporter` - Provides the ability to report heartbeat status to IANode Live.

- `observability-lib` - Provides utilities around integrating Open Telemetry metrics into Secure Agents.

- `projector-driver` - Provides the ability to connect together an Event Source and a Projector.

- `projectors-lib` - Provides an API for defining Projectors and the processing of their output(s) via Sinks.

Usage of this repository is primarily by declaring dependencies on one/more of the
library modules provided and then using their APIs for your own Secure Agents development.  Please see the
[Documentation](docs/index.md) for introductions to the various libraries and APIs provided.
